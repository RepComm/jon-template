# Jon-Template
My own wordpress template

I'm writting this from scratch<br/>
The idea is to learn the internals by using them,<br/>
learn the parts that get stuck so I can problem solve quicker,<br/>
and write an efficient/sleek theme for later use.<br/>
<br/>
The theme will end up being my go-to for when<br/>
I charge for webmaster-ing, but the theme itself<br/>
is of course open-source =)<br/>
